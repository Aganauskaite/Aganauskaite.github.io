# HTML and CSS Projects

This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

## Projects

- [Movie Theater Site](https://aganauskaite.github.io/HTML-and-CSS-projects/OnePageWebsite/Galaxy.html)


### Space Station Site

This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site

This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Boostrap 4. It contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
